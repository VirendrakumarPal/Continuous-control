## Goal
In this project, I build a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that controls a robotic arm within Unity's [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment. The goal is to get 20 different robotic arms to maintain contact with the green spheres.

A reward of +0.1 is provided for each timestep that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

In order to solve the environment, our agent must achieve a score of +30 averaged across all 20 agents for 100 consecutive episodes.

### 2. Establish Baseline
Before building an agent that learns, I started by testing an agent that selects actions (uniformly) at random at each time step.

```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment
states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
while True:
    actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # select an action (for each agent)
    actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # all actions between -1 and 1
    env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
    next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
    rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
    dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
    scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
    states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
    if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
        break
print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))
```

Running this agent a few times resulted in scores from 0.03 to 0.09. Obviously, if the agent needs to achieve an average score of 30 over 100 consecutive episodes, then choosing actions at random won't work.

### 3. Implement Algorithm
For this project, I decided to work on solving the version of the Reacher environment with 20 agents. I chose to implement the DDPG algorithm, based on a previous implementation for the Pendulum Gym environment. The decision to use DDPG was based on the fact that it extends the power of the popular DQN algorithm to environments with continuous action spaces, such as this. However, there are many other policy-based algorithms that might work well for solving this kind of environment, including: TRPO, PPO, and A3C.

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

I used [this vanilla, single-agent DDPG](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum) as a template. I further experimented with the DDPG algorithm based on other concepts covered in Udacity's classroom and lessons. My understanding and implementation of this algorithm (including various customizations) are discussed below.

#### Actor-Critic Method
Actor-critic methods leverage the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods.

Using a policy-based approach, the agent (actor) learns how to act by directly estimating the optimal policy and maximizing reward through gradient ascent. Meanwhile, employing a value-based approach, the agent (critic) learns how to estimate the value (i.e., the future cumulative reward) of different state-action pairs. Actor-critic methods combine these two approaches in order to accelerate the learning process. Actor-critic agents are also more stable than value-based agents, while requiring fewer training samples than policy-based agents.
 

we'll use thr Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process adds a certain amount of noise to the action values at each timestep. This noise is correlated to previous noise, and therefore tends to stay in the same direction for longer durations without canceling itself out. This allows the arm to maintain velocity and explore the action space with more continuity.

The final noise parameters were set as follows:

```python
OU_SIGMA = 0.2          # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
OU_THETA = 0.15         # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
EPSILON = 1.0           # explore->exploit noise process added to act step
EPSILON_DECAY = 1e-6    # decay rate for noise process
```

I implemented gradient clipping using the `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` function. I set the function to "clip" the norm of the gradients at 1, therefore placing an upper limit on the size of the parameter updates, and preventing them from growing exponentially. Once this change was implemented, along with batch normalization (discussed in the next section), my model became much more stable and my agent started learning at a much faster rate.

Batch normalization addresses this problem by scaling the features to be within the same range throughout the model and across different environments and units. In additional to normalizing each dimension to have unit mean and variance, the range of values is often much smaller, typically between 0 and 1.I added batch normalization at the outputs of the first fully-connected layers of both the actor and critic models.

### 4. Results
Once all of the various components of the algorithm were in place, my agent was able to solve the 20 agent Reacher environment. Again, the performance goal is an average reward of at least +30 over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents.

The graph below shows the final results. The best performing agent was able to solve the environment starting with the 12th episode, with a top mean score of 39.3 in the 79th episode. The complete set of results and steps can be found in [this notebook](Continuous_Control_v8.ipynb).

## Future Improvements
- **Experiment with other algorithms** &mdash; Tuning the DDPG algorithm required a lot of trial and error. Perhaps another algorithm such as [Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477), [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms), or [Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08617) would be more robust.
- **Add *prioritized* experience replay** &mdash; Rather than selecting experience tuples randomly, prioritized replay selects experiences based on a priority value that is correlated with the magnitude of error. This can improve learning by increasing the probability that rare and important experience vectors are sampled.
